        <h1>AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS </h1>
        <h2>by Jules Verne</h2>

    <main>
        <p>
            IN the year i8/z, No. 7 Savile Row, Burlington Gardens*—
the house where Sheridan* died in 1814—was occupied by
Phileas Fogg,* Esq. This gentleman was one of the most
remarkable, and indeed most remarked upon, members of the
Reform Club,* although he seemed to go out of his way to do
nothing that might attract any attention.</p>
    <p>
        One of the greatest public speakers to honour his country
        had thus been replaced by the aforesaid Phileas Fogg. The
        latter was an enigmatic figure about whom nothing was
        known, except that he was a thorough gentleman and one of
        the most handsome figures in the whole of high society.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was said to look like Byron:* his head at least, for
        his feet were beyond reproach—but a mustachioed and
        bewhiskered Byron, an impassive Byron, one who might have
        lived for a thousand years without ever growing old.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although clearly British, Mr Fogg might not have been a
Londoner. He had never been spotted in the Stock Exchange,
the Bank, or the City. The basins and docks of London had
never berthed a ship for an owner called Phileas Fogg. This
gentleman was not on any board of directors. His name had
never rung out in a barristers' chambers, whether at the
Temple, Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's Inn. He had never pleaded in
the Courts of Chancery, Queen's Bench, or Exchequer, nor in
an Ecclesiastical Court.* He was not engaged in industry,
business, commerce, or agriculture. He did not belong to the
Royal Institution of Great Britain, the London Institution, the
Artizan Society, the Russell Institution, the Western Literary
Institution, the Law Society, nor even that Society for the
Combined Arts and Sciences* which enjoys the direct patronage
 of Her Gracious Majesty. In sum, he was not a member of
any of the associations that breed so prolifically in the capital
of the United Kingdom, from the Harmonic Union* to the Entomological
 Society, founded chiefly with the aim of exterminating harmful insects.*
    </p>
    <p>
        Phileas Fogg belonged to the Reform Club—and that was
all.
Should anyone express surprise that such a mysterious
gentleman be numbered amongst the members of that distinguished
 society,* it can be pointed out here that he was
accepted on the recommendation of Messrs Baring Brothers,*
with whom he had an unlimited overdraft facility. Hence a
certain 'profile', for his cheques were always paid on sight and
his account remained invariably in the black.
    </p>

    <p>
        Was this Phileas Fogg well off? Without any doubt. But
how he had made his fortune, even the best informed could
not say. And Mr Fogg was the last person one would have
approached to find out. In any case, while in no way extravagant,
 he was not tight-fisted either. Whenever support was
needed for some noble, useful, or generous cause, he would
provide it, noiselessly and even anonymously.
